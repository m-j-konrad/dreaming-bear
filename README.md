**little platformer game with my bear** :-)

In this repository I am just experimenting with new techniques â€“ such as animating movements through moving limbs.
For  the actual ready-to-play game take a look at [this](https://github.com/m-j-konrad/apfelbaer) repository.

If you want to know the whole story of the little bear, you may [read his blog](https://www.xn--derkleinebr-u8a.de) (german)
